Documentation notes: (will write up by Monday)

- added different message types to check when receiving a PennChordPacket
  -- list types here 

- nodeinfo.h file to keep track of node location and address 

- hashes in compile script 

- notify 
  - process chord message 
      - remote node replies to successor node
      - notify successor node
      - if message is REQ_NOT, then compare hashes, update the tie wihen the predecessor was last seen 

- stabilizer timers (in join overlay)
  - starts and configured in join overlay/create overlay
  - timer is every 15 seconds 
  - if REQ_SUC, see if successor is in range, if not, then find the actual scuccesor 
  - if RSP_SUC, compare arange as above and update
  - if RSP_CP, then compare range - if in range, then set predecssor and declare stabilized 
   
  - stabilize function - set timer and debug log   
  - range compare is a hasing function 
  - remote node sets message result, originator, sends CP reply 


- ring debugging 
  - ringDebug -> sends ring debug message 
  - called if given ringstate command
